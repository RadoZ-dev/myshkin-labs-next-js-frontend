# Myshkin Labs

A digital laboratory for creative exploration — where music, code, and ideas evolve. Built as a modern headless WordPress site with Next.js frontend.

## Concept

Myshkin Labs is not a traditional blog. It's a creative laboratory organized like a real workspace, with sections that reflect the organic process of creation:

### 🧪 **Experiments**
Everything in process — demo tracks, musical sketches, unfinished code, raw ideas. The messy, evolving work that happens before polish.

### 🔧 **Instruments**
The tools of the trade — guitars, software, plugins, frameworks, and anything else used to create. A catalog of what makes the work possible.

### 📝 **Notes**
Short thoughts, philosophy, insights, "aha" moments. Observations from the laboratory floor.

### 🚀 **Releases**
When something leaves the laboratory and becomes "official" — finished projects, published music, completed code.
